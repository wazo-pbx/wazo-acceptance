    Scenario: 12 Generation of event LEAVEEMPTY
        Given there is no agents logged
        Given there is no "LEAVEEMPTY" entry in queue "q10"
        Given there are users with infos:
          | firstname | lastname | number | context     | agent_number | protocol |
          | User      |      010 |   1010 | statscenter |          010 | sip      |

        When I unlog agent "010" from the phone
        When chan_test hangs up "5010-1"
        When chan_test hangs up "5010-2"
        When I wait 3 seconds for the data processing
